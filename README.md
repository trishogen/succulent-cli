# Succulent::Cli

This CLI scrapes data from https://www.succulentsandsunshine.com and allows users to learn more about succulents. A list of succulents will be displayed by name (scientific name and common name), the user may then choose a succulent which he/she would like more information on. Additional information such as a description of the plant, ideal water conditions and ideal light conditions will be displayed. The user can then choose a different plant, go back to the main menu, or exit.

## Installation

    `$ bin/succulent-cli`

## Tests

    `$ rspec`

## Note

At the time this project was published there was a bug in the Fairy Castle Cactus web page causing the values to be scraped to be returned in different elements. For this reason this succulent has been removed from the returned results in the `SucculentCli::Scraper` class. If this is fixed, lines 26-29 of this class should be removed and should be replaced with simply `@scraped_succulents`.
